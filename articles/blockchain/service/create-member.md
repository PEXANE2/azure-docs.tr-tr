# <a name="quickstart-create-an-azure-blockchain-service-blockchain-member-using-the-azure-portal"></a>Quickstart: Create an Azure Blockchain Service blockchain member using the Azure portal

In this quickstart, you deploy a new blockchain member and consortium in Azure Blockchain Service using the Azure portal.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## <a name="create-a-blockchain-member"></a>Blok zinciri üyesi oluşturma

Create a blockchain member that runs the Quorum ledger protocol in a new or existing consortium.

1. [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)’ında oturum açın.
1. Azure portalının sol üst köşesinde bulunan **Kaynak oluştur** öğesini seçin.
1. Select **Blockchain** > **Azure Blockchain Service (preview)** .

    ![Create Service](./media/create-member/create-member.png)

    Ayar | Açıklama
    --------|------------
    Abonelik | Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for your service. Birden fazla aboneliğiniz varsa kaynağın faturalandığı aboneliği seçin.
    Kaynak grubu | Create a new resource group name or choose an existing one from your subscription.
    Bölge | Choose a region to create the member. All members of the consortium must be in the same location.
    Protokol | Currently, Azure Blockchain Service Preview supports the Quorum protocol.
    Konsorsiyum | For a new consortium, enter a unique name. If joining a consortium through an invite, choose the consortium you are joining.
    Adı | Choose a unique name for the Azure Blockchain Service member. The blockchain member name can only contain lowercase letters and numbers. İlk karakter bir harf olmalıdır. The value must be between 2 and 20 characters long.
    Member account password | The member account password is used to encrypt the private key for the Ethereum account that is created for your member. You use the member account and member account password for consortium management.
    Açıklama | Description of the consortium.
    Fiyatlandırma | The node configuration and cost for your new service. Select the **Change** link to choose between **Standard** and **Basic** tiers.
    Node password | The password for the member's default transaction node. Use the password for basic authentication when connecting to blockchain member's default transaction node public endpoint.

1. Select **Review + create** to validate your settings. Select **Create** to provision the service. Provisioning takes about 10 minutes.
1. Select **Notifications** on the toolbar to monitor the deployment process.
1. After deployment, navigate to your blockchain member.

Select **Overview**, you can view the basic information about your service including the RootContract address and member account.

## <a name="clean-up-resources"></a>Kaynakları temizleme

You can use the member you created for the next quickstart or tutorial. When no longer needed, you can delete the resources by deleting the `myResourceGroup` resource group you created for the quickstart.

To delete the resource group:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Resource group** in the left navigation pane and select the resource group you want to delete.
2. **Kaynak grubunu sil**'i seçin. Verify deletion by entering the resource group name and select **Delete**.

In this quickstart, you deployed an Azure Blockchain Service member and a new consortium. Try the next quickstart to use Azure Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum to attach to a consortium on Azure Blockchain Service.
